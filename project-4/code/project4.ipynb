Fortunately none of the variables were colinear so we proceeded to generate dummy variables of the prestige columns in order to run a logistic regression of the GPA, GRE, and prestige, given the admission outcome. The method we used was the Logit MLE (maximum likelyhood estimate). We then fitted the model and used the model to determine the odds for each variables. In addition we then ran predictions on all possible permutations of prestige, GPA, and GRE, using the fitted model."
